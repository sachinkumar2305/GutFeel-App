# GutFeel Video Variation Strategy

## Content Types

### 1. Absurd
- Extreme visual metaphors (e.g., "gut bacteria party")
- Unexpected, humorous, or surreal scenes

### 2. Relatable
- Everyday gut health struggles
- Common scenarios (e.g., bloating after a meal, busy mornings)

### 3. Educational
- Visual explanations of gut health
- Animated diagrams, infographics, or expert voiceover

### 4. Transformation
- Before/after scenarios
- Personal stories of gut health improvement

### 5. Problem-Agitation
- Symptom visualization
- Highlighting pain points and the need for solutions

## Implementation Guidance
- For each hook, generate at least one video script in each style
- Use the Veo3 JSON template to specify camera, character, lighting, and style for each variation
- Ensure diversity in visuals, tone, and pacing

## Example
- Absurd: "A group of animated gut bacteria throw a party inside a stomach, confetti everywhere."
- Relatable: "A young professional struggles with stomach pain during a meeting."
- Educational: "A 3D animation shows how probiotics help gut health."
- Transformation: "A before/after split screen of a person’s energy and mood."
- Problem-Agitation: "Close-up of a person grimacing, with animated symptoms swirling around."
